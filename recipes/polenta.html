        <h3>Description</h3>
        <P>polenta, a porridge or mush usually made of ground corn (maize) cooked in salted water. Cheese and butter or oil are often added.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup polenta</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Pour in polenta steadily, stirring constantly. Continue to stir until polenta is thickened. It should come away from sides of the pan, and be able to support a spoon. This can take anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes. Pour polenta onto a wooden cutting board, let stand for a few minutes.</li>
